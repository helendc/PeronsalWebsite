        <button type='button' class='collapsible inactive' id="coll0"><h4>Major in Computer Science</h4>
        <p>I intially became interested in Computer Science when my older sister decided to major in CS. I took a very elementary intro course in high school to dip my foot in the subject. Then in my first semester at UNC I was able to get into the Intro course to the CS major sequence - from there it's all history! I absolutely fell in love with CS. In particular I love how you can implementation solutions to a problem in so many different ways! CS always challenges me to approach problems from new perspectives. </p></button>
        <ul id="content0" style="display:none; padding-inline-start: 100px;">
            <li>Introduction to Programming</li>
            <ol><li>The first college level CS course I took. I fell in love with CS and became a TA for this course afterwards!</li></ol>
            <li>Foundation of Programming</li>
            <ol><li>A course focused on object-oriented programming and a deep dive into debugging! This course inspired my sushi project!</li></ol>
            <li>Data Structures</li>
            <ol><li>I learned about abstract data - lists, stakcs, queues, trees, graphs and more! This class really emphasized the importance of efficient coding - both in time and in space. </li></ol>
            <li>Computer Organization</li>
            <ol><li>This course covered everything from binary arithmetic to logic gates and circuits to performance measures to solving problems in C and assembly code. </li></ol>
            <li>Modern Web Programming</li>
            <ol><li>A course that taught me the ins and outs of web programming - both back end and front end. I made this website as final project!</li></ol>
            <li>Data Science for Earth Systems</li>
            <ol><li>This course introduced me to machine learning and data science specifically within the realm of analyzing Earth systems. For the first time, I worked with real meta-data from sources like NOAA and USGS to answer critical questions and used machine learning to answer them. For my final project, I analyzed flooding patterns in New Orleans!</li></ol>
            <li>Data Science in the Business World</li>
            <ol><li>explanation and many projects</li></ol>
            <li>Introduction to Security Concepts</li>
            <ol><li>From learning attacks with emojis representing the attacker to coding attacks and countermeasures in low level languages</li></ol>
            <li>Models of Languages and Compuations</li>
            <ol><li>This course dove into the theory of computation. I learned all about finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, and Turing machines. I mastered the skill of drawing graphical representations of these by end of the semseter.</li></ol>
            <li>Algorithms and Analysis</li>
            <ol><li>In this course, I learned different techniques of algoritm analysis and problem-solving paradigms. </li></ol>
            <li>Beyond Object Oriented Programming</li>
            <ol><li>This course challenged a lot of the basics I have learned in Computer Science, going beyond object oriented programming. We visited core computer science questions like the Dining Philsopher Problem and concurrency and evaluated them from a different perspectives.</li></ol>
            <li>Computational Photography</li>

        <button type='button' class='collapsible inactive' id="coll1"><h4>Minor in Mathematics</h4>
        <p>I have always had a fondness for math beginning with Mad Minutes back in elementary school. I love the problem solving aspect of math, looking for solutions, putting a puzzle together, the satisfication when it all clicks and makes sense. Pursuing a minor in Mathematics pushed me to use my brain in different ways.</p></button>
        <ul id="content1" style="display:none">
            <li>Calculus of Functions of One Variable I & II and of Several Variables</li>
            <ol><li>Calculus classes were surely challengely, but boy did they pay off - in every semester after I completed calculus I saw derivatives, integrals, or an important theorem reappear in my other STEM classes.</li></ol>
            <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
            <ol><li>I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered math beyond Calculus. This class was particularly interesting as it intersected with many logical Computer Science topics. This was also my first course that transitioned to online learning during the Pandemic - talk about a learning curve!</li></ol>
            <li>First Course in Differential Equations</li>
            <ol><li>explanation</li></ol>
            <li>Linear Algebra for Applications</li>
            <ol><li>Taking Linear Algebra during a summer session was an awesome experience because I could focus all my attention to one topic.</li></ol>
            <li>Combinatorial Mathematics</li>
            <ol><li>This course was phenomial. It was my first course back in person after the Pandemic, and this course focused on the HOW rather than the answer to problems, which I loved.</li></ol>
            <li>Introduction to Probability</li>
            <ol><li>I took this course during the same semester that I took Data Science in Business World - the intersection of these two courses was perfect timing. I was learning all about probability distributions in my math course and applying them in machine-learning forms to real world scenarios in my Data Science course.</li></ol>
        </ul>
        <button type='button' class='collapsible inactive' id="coll2"><h4>Interdisciplinary Courses</h4>
        <p>Below I've listed a few courses I took outside of my major and minor that proved to be extremely interesting and helped me learn and think wholistically!</p></button>

            <li>As a Summer Analyst in the Technology Development Program, I worked with a data migration and conversion team for a large fin-tech acquisition and merge.</li>
            <li>I completed modules in Salesforce and nCino platforms, learning back end development and functionality. Some of the skills I earned in the Salesforce platform can be seen in the pie chart below!</li>
            <li>I completed mappings and fixed defects for meta-data in Informatica and analyzed results in SQL server for my project team. I was extremely excited about this as I felt I was contributing value to my team while also learning new skills in a platform I had never used before!</li>
            <li>Throughout the summer, I was able to sharpen my communicative, organizational, and management skills through tasks such as creating visuals, timelines, & slide decks, keeping records updated in excel, and participating in daily standups.</li>
            <li>Beyond these professional and technical skills I developed during this summer with Accenture, I was also able to grow personally. I partook in small group sessions of interns, book clubs, faith-based groups, and leadership conferences. I even participated in a virtual bake-off with the office team (pictured below)! And lastly, I was able to network with the most inspiring and dedicated employees!</li>

            </div>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>As a UTA of 7 semesters, I advised over 500 students in COMP110, the Introductory Computer Science course at UNC, each semester.</li>
            <li>I held office hours to facilitate the general understanding of concepts to students in both the CS major and in non-STEM majors and to help students work through specific problem sets.</li>
            <li>Some semesters, I attended the course's lectures to answer questions during class and proctor exams.</li>
            <li>Other semesters, I wrote worksheet questions and exercises, and helped grade projects and exams.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite ways to serve the class was getting to tutor students. This was time setup apart from office hours that allowed students struggling conceptually in the course the chance to catch up and learn at a pace more tailored to their needs.</li>
            <li>Another particular effort I loved was being a mentor to younger Undergrad Teaching Assistants who were new to the UTA team. I was able to advise them in being a UTA, as well as general knowledge about the CS major and recruiting.</li>
